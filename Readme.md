###Simple Tax Calculator

I have completed the coding challenge using JS,HTML and Bootstrap.
Logic used :
I assumed total salary would be inclusive of Super Annuation . With current super rate as 10.5%
So, For calculating Tax, I have initially negated the super amount from Total salary , then calculated the total tax based on ATO rates.
